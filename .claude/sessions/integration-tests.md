- [2026-06-17 06:51Z] END-GATE: 26 integration tests across 5 suites (lifecycle 7, attach 5, rename 6, sequence 4, clean 4). TempWorkspace harness with ccsm binary auto-detection. 65 total tests. NOT done: lock concurrency tests (needs multi-process), archive integration tests, doctor integration tests. Backlog #1 item from audit is sufficiently addressed — unblocks main.rs refactoring.

- [2026-06-17 06:51Z] 8 more integration tests: 4 sequence (new→start→scope→tag→complete pipeline, trash→recover, duplicate rejection, empty args error) + 4 clean (remove entry, nonexistent, clean-all trashed only, empty clean-all). 65 total tests.

- [2026-06-17 06:41Z] 11 more integration tests: 5 attach (UUID, validation, auto-discover, nonexistent, empty→autodiscover) + 6 rename (basic, -g/-s topic change, nonexistent, duplicate, kebab validation, preserves status+tags). 57 total.

- [2026-06-17 06:22Z] 7 lifecycle integration tests added: new→start→note→complete, start→block→abandon, trash→recover, pending reset, duplicate rejection, --force bypass, list --summary/--status. 46 total tests (up from 38).

- [2026-06-17 06:14Z] Session created. Integration tests are the #1 priority from ccsm-audit-and-vision — unblocks main.rs modularization.
